## Note on BLM
I intend to add a dedicated and globally accessible section for people to access and explore a collection of works by Black authors and activists. I believe a core proliferator of racism in the United States is miseducation, and I want to do something to help people educate themselves through the voices of POC (people of color). There are embedded levels of racism in all of us, much of which goes unnoticed by most people; this includes: the way we speak about under-privileged communities, coded language, our perception of police, our impression of the prison industrial complex, and how our collective idea of "justice" has been shaped by political leaders and the media. It is important for all of us to recognize how we think about these things and adapt our world view through exposure to new sources of information. If we as a society learn to look at this through a different lens, we can move forward to a society based on anti-racism.

It is important to note that educating ourselves is not be a solution, but a stepping stone. It does not stop after reading a book or an article. Nonetheless, it is an integral stepping stone toward change that incorporates the world views of _everyone_ so that _everyone_ may be equally represented. -->
